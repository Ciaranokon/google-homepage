The Odin Project - Google Homepage copy

This is my first time cloning a page. Was a pretty steep learning curve.

Have made a few web pages previously with very basic design.

Through this Google Homepage Clone I have improved on the following areas/items:

SVGs - first time using any sort of media other than images which presented new challenges in regards to applying CSS.
Flex - Have used Flexbox previously but feel like I achieved a greater understanding through this clone.

Page Responsiveness - Although responsiveness is pretty terrible here, this is my first approach at implementing media queries.
Lack a large degree of understanding in regards to responsiveness but it was nice to get some aspects up and running on this clone.

Will come back to this later when I feel like I can add more or most importantly clean up my code once I have a better overall understanding.
